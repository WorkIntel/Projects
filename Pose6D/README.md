# Introduction

This demo shows implementation of 6 DoF pose estimation based on RGB only and known object.
The code is available from RobotAI site (https://wwww.robotai.info)

-   Estimate Background : estimates background using multiple gaussian models
-   Detection  : estimates regions that will be detected as intrusions

This code could be integrated in your robotics and video processing pipe line.
 

## Installation Windows

1. install Pose6D executable:
2. Connect to RealSense camera
3. Acquire dataset of the object you want to detect
4. Label the data using RobotAI labeling tool
5. Train AI model
6. Run Pose6D software to detect the object in real time
